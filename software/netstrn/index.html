<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
NETSTRN is a software package that determines point strain parameters
for a coordinate displacement field derived from two given sets of
geodetic coordinates of points in a network. Also included is a
basic plotting program (PLTSTRN) for depicting the strain parameters
on-screeen.
<P>
The strain computation algorithm employed by NETSTRN is based on the
methods used in the NETVAL software for analysing the strength of
geodetic networks. For details, see:

Craymer, Vanicek and Tarvydas (1989). NETAN -- A computer program
for the interactive analysis of geodetic networks. CISM Journal,
Vol. 43, No. 1, Spring 1989, pp. 25-37.

The following files are provided with the software package:

	README.TXT    Documentation file
	NETSTRN.CMD   Input command file for NETSTRN
	NETSTRN.EXE   PC executable code for NETSTRN
	NETSTRN.FOR   Source code for NETSTRN
	PLTSTRN.EXE   PC executable code for PLTSTRN
	PLTSTRN.FOR   Source code for PLTSTRN
	COMMON1.INC   Include file for NETSTRN
	COMMON2.INC   Include file for NETSTRN
	FLPS.BAT      Lahey F77L compile/link batch file for PLTSTRN
	ABSM.DAT      Data file for test network by ABSM
	GSI.DAT       Data file for test network by GSI
	WWD.DAT       Data file for test network by WWD
	ABSM-GSI.CMD  Command file for ABSM-GSI comparison
	ABSM-GSI.STR  Output strain results for ABSM-GSI
	ABSM-GSI.PLT  Output plotting data for PLTSTRN program
	GSI-WWD.CMD   Command file for GSI-WWD comparison
	GSI-WWD.STR   Output strain results for GSI-WWD
	GSI-WWD.PLT   Output plotting data for PLTSTRN program

Note that these programs were written for the Lahey Fortran compiler.
The PLTSTRN program also uses the PLOT88 graphics library. Significant
changes will likely be required for other graphics libraries.

<H2>System Requirements</H2>
<P>
The NETSTRN.EXE and PLTSTRN.EXE executable files are command-line programs
that have been compiled for a Windows computer. The NETSTRN source code
has been successfully compiled with the Lahey F77L Fortran compiler and 
should be portable to an other Fortran 77 compilers supporting the common
VAX extensions. The PLTSTRN source code has also been successfully compiled
with the Lahey F77L compiler and the PLOT88 graphics library. Significant
changes will likely be required for other graphics libraries.
