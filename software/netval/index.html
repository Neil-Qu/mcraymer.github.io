<P>
NETVAL is a software package that provides analysis tools for
evaluating GPS surveys.  It is well known that traditional methods of
assessing the accuracy of networks using 95% confidence regions are
too unreliable for GPS.  Consequently many government agencies are now
developing specifications for GPS surveys following the approach
advocated by Craymer, Vanicek and Wells in their "Report on Urban GPS
Research Project, Phase III Ð Evaluation, Volume 3, Specifications and
Guidelines" prepared for the City of Edmonton.  By this approach
potential contractors are required to demonstrate their ability to
perform GPS surveys to a specified accuracy on a test network.  NETVAL
can be used to evaluate such results and to determine whether or not
the required accuracy has been achieved.
<P>
NETVAL is primarily designed for use by agencies responsible for
contracting out GPS surveys.  NETVAL will permit these agencies to
check whether a potential contractor's GPS results meet a specified
accuracy.  Presently the Province of Alberta and the Canadian Geodetic
Survey both use NETVAL to evaluate potential GPS contractors on their
test networks.  In addition to validating potential GPS contractors,
NETVAL can also provide a check on the accuracy of densification
networks by comparing computed positions at control points with their
known values.
<P>
Potential contractors can also benefit from NETVAL by checking that
their procedures for GPS surveys are capable of satisfying the
accuracies required by contracting agencies.  This can be done prior
to any validation testing by the contracting agency thereby avoiding
embarrassing failures.
<P>
NETVAL evaluates both the internal and external accuracy of a
3-dimensional network using a variety of network analysis tools.  The
internal accuracy is based on the covariance matrix of the GPS network
which is known not to be very reliable.  The external accuracy
analyses provides a more reliable method to assess the quality of the
results by comparing them to known values established by higher order
standards.
<P>
NETVAL consists of the following suite of 6 programs:
<DL>
	<DT>NETDAT</DT>
		<DD>Converts GeoLab data files to the format required for
		input to the following NETVAL programs.</DD>
	<DT>NETREG</DT>
		<DD>Evaluates the internal accuracy of a network by computing
		1-d, 2-d and 3-d absolute and relative confidence regions at a
		specified confidence level for all stations and station pairs.
		 The sizes of the regions are checked against the maxima
		allowed by 1st, 2nd or 3rd order specifications.</DD>
	<DT>NETDIF</DT>
		<DD>Evaluates the external accuracy by analysing the
		coordinate differences between the test results and the known
		positions.  The differences are checked against the maxima
		allowed by 1st, 2nd or 3rd order specifications and a variety
		of statistical tests are used to check the compatibility of
		the test results with the known positions.</DD>
	<DT>NETRAN</DT>
		<DD>Evaluates the external accuracy by computing datum
		differences such as translations, rotations and scale
		differences between the test results and known positions.  The
		test network may optionally be corrected for any such datum
		differences for further analyses.</DD>
	<DT>NETSTR</DT>
		<DD>Evaluates the external accuracy by computing local
		distortions of the test results with respect to the known
		positions.  The distortions are given in terms of strain
		parameters at each point.</DD>
	<DT>PLTSTR</DT>
		<DD>Graphically displays and prints the strain parameters
		determined by NETSTR for easy identification of distorted
		areas of the network.  NO LONGER DISTRIBUTED DUE TO
		INCOMPATIBILITY WITH MODERN PC'S.</DD>

<H2>System Requirements</H2>
<P>
NETVAL is written in ANSI Fortran 77 and is provided as DOS
executables that can be run on Windows computers. The graphics program
PLTSTR requires an EGA-compatible graphics adapter and is not likely
to work in more recent PC's.

<H2>Documentation & Support</H2>
<P>
The NETVAL software package includes an extensive reference manual
describing the input and output for all programs, the algorithms used
and guidelines for interpreting the results.  The manual can also be
downloaded separately at the following link:

<P>
NETVAL is presently being distributed free of charge but without any
support. Use at your own risk.
