<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
SPADE is a program that computes the astronomic azimuth of either the Sun or
Polaris to an accuracy of less than 1 second of arc.  No astronomical tables or
polynomial coefficients are required.  SPADE is primarily designed for use by
land surveyors. It runs on Windows computers in the Command Prompt window. It
is an old DOS program from the era before Microsoft Windows. It uses an old
text-based, menu-driven user interface (no mousing around).

<P>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI>No astronomical tables or polynomial coefficients required; SPADE computes
	    the precise position of the Sun or Polaris at the exact time of observation
    <P>
	<LI>Zenith distance and hour angle solutions supported, the latter with or without
	    a semi-diameter correction
    <P>
	<LI>Field book-style data entry of either individual or averaged angles for each
	    observation set.
    <P>
	<LI>Automatic reduction of azimuth to a reference object
    <P>
	<LI>Error analysis provided for identifying weak solutions
    <P>
	<LI>Individual solutions may be omitted from the final average azimuth
    <P>
	<LI>Input and results may be saved to a disk file
    <P>
	<LI>Free support and version 4.x updates for registered users
