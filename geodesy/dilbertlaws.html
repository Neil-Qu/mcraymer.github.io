Then quit. No use being a damn	fool about it.	<P>	<LI>Everything can be filed under "miscellaneous."	<P>	<LI>Never delay the ending of a meeting or the beginning of a cocktail hour.	<P>	<LI>To err is human, to forgive is not our policy.	<P>	<LI>Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn't the work he/she is	supposed to be doing.	<P>	<LI>If you are good, you will be assigned all the work. If you are really	good, you will get out of it.	<P>	<LI>You are always doing something marginal when the boss drops by your desk.	<P>	<LI>People who go to conferences are the ones who shouldn't.	<P>	<LI>If it wasn't for the last minute, nothing would get done.	<P>	<LI>When you don't know what to do, walk fast and look worried.	<P>	<LI>When confronted by a difficult problem you can solve it more easily by	reducing it to the question, "How would the Lone Ranger handle this?"	<P>	<LI>No matter how much you do, you never do enough.</UL></BODY></HTML>
