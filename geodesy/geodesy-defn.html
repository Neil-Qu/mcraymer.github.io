Geodesistsalso study geodynamical phenomena such as crustal motion, tides, and polarmotion. For this they design global and national control networks, usingspace and terrestrial techniques while relying on datums and coordinatesystems.<P><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy">Full article</A><P><!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- --><HR><P><H3>Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 2001 edition, Academic Press, 2000</H3><P>Geodesy is a science, the oldest earth (geo-) science, in fact. It was born offear and curiosity, driven by a desire to predict natural happenings and callsfor the understanding of these happenings. The classical definition, accordingto one of the "fathers of geodesy" reads: "Geodesy is the science of measuringand portraying the earth's surface" [Helmert, 1880, p.3]. Nowadays, weunderstand the scope of geodesy to be somewhat wider. It is captured by thefollowing definition [Vanicek and Krakiwsky, 1986, p.45]:<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"Geodesy is the discipline that deals with the measurement and representation ofthe earth, including its gravity field, in a three-dimensional time varyingspace."</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A HREF="http://gge.unb.ca/Research/GeodesyGroup/tutorial/tutorial.htm">Full article by Petr Vanicek</A><P><!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- --><HR><P><H3>Definition from the Geodetic Survey Division, Natural Resources Canada</H3><P>Geodesy is the study of the shape and size of the earth.<P><A HREF="http://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/edu/geod/index_e.php">Full article</A><P><!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- --><HR><P><H3>From "Geodesy", 2nd Edition by Wolfgang Torge. deGruyter, 1991, p.1</H3><P>According to the classical definition of F.R. Helmert (A 1880), geodesy is the"science of the measurement and mapping of the earth's surface". This definitionhas to this day retained its validity; it includes the determination of theearth's external gravity field, as well as the surface of the ocean floor. Withthis definition, which as to be extended to include temporal variations of theearth and its gravity field, geodesy may be included in the geosciences, andalso in engineering sciences, e.g., National Academy of Sciences (1978).<P>Triggered by the development of space exploration, geodesy turned incollaboration with other sciences toward the determination of the surfaces ofother celestial bodies (moon, other planets). The corresponding disciplines arecalled selenodesy and planetary geodesy. (Bills and Synnot 1987).<P>Geodesy may be divided into the areas of global geodesy, national geodeticsurveys, and plane surveying. Global geodesy is responsible for thedetermination of the figure of the earth and of the external gravity field. Ageodetic survey establishes the fundamentals for the determination of thesurface and gravity field of a country. This is realized by coordinates andgravity values of a sufficiently large number of control points, arranged ingeodetic and gravimetric networks. In this fundamental work, curvature and thegravity field of the earth must be considered. In plane surveying (topographicsurveying, cadastral surveying, engineering surveying), the details of theterrain are obtained. In plane surveying, the horizontal plane is generallysufficient.<P>There is close cooperation between global geodesy, geodetic surveying and planesurveying. The geodetic survey adopts the parameters determined by measurementsof the earth, and its own results are available to those who measure the earth.The plane surveys, in turn, are generally tied to the control points of thegeodetic surveys and serve then particularly in the development of national mapseries and in the formation of real estate cadastres. Measurement and evaluationmethods are largely identical in global geodesy and national geodetic surveys.Particularly space methods (satellite geodesy) enter more and more into regionaland even local surveys. This also implies more detailed gravity fielddetermination on regional and local scale.<P>With the corresponding classifications in the realms of the English and Frenchlanguages, the concept of "geodesy" (la geodesie, "hoher Geodasie" afterHelmert) is to be referred only to global geodesy and geodetic surveying. Theconcept of "surveying" (la topometrie, Vermessungskunde or "niedere Geodasie"after Helmert) shall encompass plane surveying.<P>References<P>National Academy of Sciences, Commission on Geodesy -- Geodesy: Trend andprospects.
