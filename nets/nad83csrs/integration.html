The traditionalapproach is based on measurements (or connections) to existing control pointswith known positions in the NAD83(CSRS) datum. The NAD83 positions of the localsurvey are determined indirectly from the known NAD83 positions of the controlpoints.  The other method of integration is based on precise GPS pointpositioning using the precise GPS ephemerides and clock corrections asdetermined by the CACS tracking network.  In this case, the satelliteseffectively serve as the known control points.  Each of these methods will bediscussed here.<P>Whatever method of integration is used, it should be evaluated through testing(such as a GPS validation survey) to ensure it is capable of providing therequired accuracy.  In addition, a sufficient level of redundancy should beincorporated into the method to verify the achieved accuracy.</P><H3>Integration via Precise Point Positioning</H3>GPS point positioning using pseudo-ranges is the most common method of GPSpositioning.  Although it provides positions in real-time, the normal accuracyof this standard mode of operation is only about 100 m horizontal and 150 mvertical at the 95% confidence level.  However, by using precise GPS ephemeridesand clock corrections from the Canadian Active Control System (CACS), muchgreater accuracy can be obtained.  In low multipath environments and under goodsatellite geometry (GDOP ² 5), individual point positions can be obtained withan accuracy of better than 2 m horizontally at the 95% confidence region.<P>The point positioning accuracy is mainly limited by ionospheric, troposphericand multipath effects as well as the accuracy of the satellite ephemerides andthe resolution of the pseudo-range measurements of the GPS receiver.  Thefollowing steps can be taken by the user to minimize the effects of these errorsources:<P><UL TYPE=DISC><LI>Accuracy of ephemerides and clock corrections:  Precise ephemerides andclock corrections should be used in order to achieve metre level accuracy. Although precise ephemerides are available from some organizations participatingin the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS), only a few provide thenecessary clock corrections for precise point positioning. Care must be alsoexercised to ensure the resulting positions are in the required coordinatesystem or datum (i.e., NAD83).<P><B>Note:</B>  The Geodetic Survey Division (GSD) makes available preciseephemerides in both NAD83(CSRS) and the International Terrestrial ReferenceFrame (compatible with WGS84), as well as precise clock corrections.  Theprecise ephemerides and clock corrections can be applied using the GPSPACEsoftware (also available from GSD as part of its CACS product line).  A fewother commercial GPS software packages are also capable of using thisinformation to perform precise point positioning.<P><LI>Ionospheric effects:  This effect varies with sunspot activity and ismore pronounced at northern latitudes and the equator.  Currently, the onlyreliable way of minimizing this effect is to use dual frequency GPS receivers tocorrect for the bulk of the error.  Strong ionospheric effects can also causeloss of "lock" on the GPS signals for which there is no remedy.  It is alwaysadvisable to monitor the ionospheric prediction bulletins and avoid periods ofhigh ionospheric activity .<P><LI>Tropospheric effects:  Standard tropospheric models can reduce the bulkof this effect.  Testing indicates that the remaining residual errors aretypically less than about a decimetre.  If necessary, the residual errors can berandomized by over long observing periods or by multiple occupations atdifferent times of the day and on different days.<P><LI>Multipath effects:  This effect is a function of the geometry of theobserved satellite configuration.  Because the geometry changes systematicallyover time, the error can be randomized and "averaged out" over time.  However,the length of averaging time needed depends on the local multipath conditionsand is difficult to predict in advance.  It is best to avoid potential multipathenvironments and to average over multiple occupations at different times.<P><LI>Measurement resolution:  This error is small and considered random.  Ifnecessary, it can be reduced by averaging over time.</UL><P>Local surveys can be integrated into NAD83(CSRS) using estimated point positionsas position observations, weighted by their estimated standard deviations, in anover-constrained network adjustment.  In order to provide checks on the presenceof the above systematic effects and obtain realistic estimates of the standarddeviations of the estimated point positions, a sufficient level of redundancyshould be incorporated into the method of integration.  Generally, this involvesmultiple occupations of multiple stations in the local network.  For example, aminimum of three stations is usually sufficient to provide independent checks onan error in the point position of any one station, while independentreoccupations of stations made at different times of the day can be used torandomize potential systematic errors (e.g., multipath) and obtain morerealistic accuracy estimates.  Tests have shown that realistic accuracyestimates can usually be obtained with 2 hrs. of data.<P>The local survey may also be used to verify the relative accuracy of theestimated point positions for different points in the project.  The coordinatedifferences between the point positions should be statistically compatible withthe coordinate differences from the local survey.  The compatibility can beassessed by comparing the estimated point positions to those derived from aminimally constrained adjustment of the local survey with one of the pointpositions fixed.  Any statistically incompatible discrepancies should also berevealed as "outliers" in a combined (over-constrained) adjustment of the localsurvey and the estimated point positions.  Significant outliers or discrepanciesmay be due to errors in the estimated point positions, errors in the localsurvey or incorrect weighting of the point positions or the local survey.</P><H3>Integration via Direct Connections to Control Points</H3>The traditional method of integrating local surveys into NAD83 is to directlyconnect them to existing control points with known coordinates in the NAD83datum.  Positions for the local survey are determined indirectly from the knownpositions of the control points.  Care must be taken, however, to ensure thatthe control points are in the correct reference system and of sufficientaccuracy.<P>Although it may be possible to physically occupy control points nearby, thesemay not be of sufficient accuracy (particularly in remote areas) or even in thecorrect reference system.  It is often more convenient and accurate to computeGPS baselines directly to the continuously operating CACS stations using theirGPS carrier phase observations.  The carrier phase data for all CACS stations isavailable from GSD in RINEX format at a 30 sec. data rate.  Although thepositioning accuracy of this method is generally much better than precise pointpositioning, it is limited mainly by the same effects as for point positioning,as well as the accuracy of the known control.  The following steps can be takenby the user to minimize the effects of these error sources:<P><UL TYPE=DISC><LI>Orbit errors:  The effect on baseline vectors of errors in the currentbroadcast GPS ephemerides can generally be reduced to the decimetre levelthrough "double difference" carrier phase processing.  More accurate results canbe achieved using precise ephemerides, such as those available from GSD.<P><B>Note:</B>  It is important to ensure the computed baseline vectors are inthe required coordinate system (i.e., NAD83).  Most GPS software computebaseline vectors in the coordinate system of the satellite ephemerides.  Thus,if broadcast ephemerides are used, the computed baselines will be in the WGS84reference system .  Depending on the length, orientation and location of thebaseline and accuracy required, it may be necessary to transform the computedbaselines to NAD83.  For example, in the far north where baselines to CACSstations can be over 2000 km long, the differences between baselines inNAD83(CSRS) and WGS84/ITRF94 may reach the few decimetre level.  It is generallymore convenient to instead use precise ephemerides expressed in the NAD83(CSRS)reference system.  In this case the baselines are computed directly in NAD83 andno transformation will be required.  GSD provides precise ephemerides in bothNAD83(CSRS) and ITRF.  For those using ephemerides in WGS84 or ITRF, GSD canalso provide parameters for transforming the resulting baselines to NAD83(CSRS).<P><LI>Ionospheric effects:  As for point positioning, the only reliableway of minimizing the effects of the ionosphere is to use dual frequency GPSreceivers to correct for the bulk of the error.  It is also advisable to monitorthe ionospheric prediction bulletins and avoid periods of high ionosphericactivity .<P><LI>Tropospheric effects:  Over baselines less than about 30-50 km,much of the tropospheric effect can be reduced through double difference carrierphase processing.  Over longer baselines the effect can become significant,depending on weather conditions, but is generally small and not likely to be ofmuch consequence for integration purposes.  If necessary, the residual error maybe partially randomized and averaged out though multiple occupations of pointsat different times of the day.<P><LI>Multipath effects:  As for point positioning, it is best to avoidpotential multipath environments and to try to average out part of the effect bycollecting baseline data over a longer period of time and at different times ofthe day.<P><LI>Measurement resolution:  For geodetic quality GPS receivers, thecarrier phase measurement error is generally considered random and insignificant(mm level) in comparison to the systematic errors above.<P><LI>Ambiguity resolution:  For baseline less than about 30-100 km it iscommon practice to try to resolve and fix the unknown integer carrier phaseambiguities in order to improve the precision of the estimated baseline vector. Different GPS survey techniques (e.g., rapid static, kinematic, static) usedifferent methods to reliably and accurately determine the ambiguities.  Theparticular technique used should be adequately evaluated in a GPS validationsurvey.  Over longer lines up to about 100 km, only the static technique cangenerally be used to resolve and fix the integer ambiguities.  For even longerlines (e.g., to CACS stations), it is not recommended to try to fix theambiguities to integer values.<P><LI>Accuracy of known control:  The accuracy of the positions for theknown control points depends primarily on the quality of the existing controlnetwork. Traditional horizontal control networks suffer from the accumulation oferrors in the hundreds of thousands of measurements needed to constructconventional national and regional networks.  For example, the national NAD83horizontal networks is now known to contain errors of the order of 0.25 to morethan a few metres in remote areas such as the far north.  It is stronglyrecommended to use instead the more modern 3D control networks comprising theCSRS, which utilize high accuracy GPS techniques over longer lines to reduce theaccumulation of errors and greatly improve accuracy.  These 3D networks includethe CACS, CBN and provincial/regional high precision networks.  For example, thepositional accuracy of the CACS network is about 1 cm, while that for the CBN isabout 2-5 cm.  Regional HPNs are expected to have positional accuracies of about5-10 cm.</UL><P>Local surveys can be integrated into NAD83(CSRS) by combining them withbaselines to control stations in an over-constrained adjustment, using thepublished positions of the control stations and their standard deviations asposition observations (constraints).  However, care must be taken to ensurethere is a sufficient level of redundancy to provide checks on these baselinesand that they are weighted appropriately with respect to those in the localsurvey.  As for the point positioning method, this generally involves baselinesfrom multiple stations in the local network to multiple control points made atdifferent times of the day.  For example, a minimum of three points in the localsurvey each connected to at least 3 known control points in NAD83(CSRS) isusually sufficient to detect any error in one of the baselines to the control. Computing baselines to CACS stations is generally the most convenient method ofconnecting a local survey to NAD83(CSRS).  In this case a minimum of only 2 CACSconnections from each of the local survey points may be needed because of thegreater reliability of CACS data and positions, providing there are redundantconnections to CACS from other points in the local network.  Testing hasindicated that decimetre level accuracy can be achieved on baselines to CACSstations up to a couple of thousand km. away using the static carrier phaseprocessing technique with 1 hr. of data.<P>The local survey may also be used to verify the accuracy of the baselineconnections to the control points if there is a sufficient number of redundantconnections to the control network.  Any statistical incompatibility between thelocal survey and the connections to the control network should be revealed as"outliers" in the baseline residuals from either a minimally constrained andover-constrained adjustment of all the baselines.  Significant outliers may bedue to errors in the baselines to the control points, errors in the local surveyor incorrect weighting of the baselines.  Care should be taken to ensure thebaselines to the control points are correctly weighted relative to those in thelocal survey during the over-constrained adjustment.  Weights derived fromstandard deviations or covariance matrices that are too optimistic may distortthe local network.</P><H3>Combined Approach</H3>The two methods of integration described above are not mutually exclusive.  Infact, because they are based on different observables (pseudo-ranges versuscarrier phases), absolute point positions can be used together with baselines tocontrol points to provide checks on each other and improve redundancy withoutany additional cost in terms of observations.<H3>Validation of Integration Method</H3>Whatever method of integration is used, it should be thoroughly tested andevaluated on a network with known, accurate positions in NAD83(CSRS) to ensureit is capable of providing sufficient accuracy and reliability.  This shouldnormally be done during the validation of the local survey methodology.  It isvery important that the testing be carried out under similar conditions to whichthe integration is to be used in practice.  For example, the distances from thelocal survey to the known control points (e.g., CACS stations) should be typicalof what will be expected during the actual survey.<H3>Further Information</H3>For further information about the CSRS, CACS products or network integrationissues, contact the Geodetic Survey Division of Geomatics Canada.
