In bothcountries, NAD83 is the adopted datum for spatial positioning.  It wasinitially realized in the mid-1980s by adjusting primarily classicalgeodetic observations that connected a network of monumented controlpoints spanning North America.  Although the new NAD83 realization iscompatible with the original one within the accuracies of thoseclassical observations, the wide use of high precision GPS surveyssince then have required a more rigorous definition of NAD83 in termsof network scale, ellipsoidal heights and crustal motion.  In aneffort to provide a more precise realization of a 3D NAD83 common toboth countries, and to comply with IAG resolutions recommending thatreference systems be tied to the ITRS, Canada and the U.S. havecollaborated in the determination of a common transformation betweenthe ITRF and the fundamental 3D datum of NAD83.  This conformalsimilarity transformation is based upon ITRF96, the latest realizationof ITRF.  Through the use of continuously operating GPS stations (CACSin Canada and CORS in the U.S.) forming part of the ITRF, thistransformation also provides more accurate and convenient access tothe NAD83 reference frame.  It also allows for the conversion of IGSprecise GPS ephemerides from ITRF to NAD83, thereby enabling highaccuracy GPS surveys to be performed entirely within NAD83.<P><HR><P><H3>1. Background</H3><P>The adopted datum or reference system for spatial positioning inCanada and the United States (U.S.) is the North American Datum of1983 (NAD83).  The original 1986 realization of this datum was definedto be compatible with the BIH Terrestrial System BTS84, which was thebest available global reference frame at the time.  The origin ofBTS84 was defined largely by satellite laser ranging (SLR), while itsorientation was defined by astronomic observations and its scale byboth SLR and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).<P>NAD83, on the other hand, was realized mainly through Dopplerobservations using internationally accepted transformations from theDoppler reference frame to BTS84.  VLBI stations were also included toprovide an accurate connection to other reference frames. AlthoughNAD83 is defined by a three dimensional reference frame, access to itby end users for general spatial positioning needs was providedthrough a dense network of horizontal control monuments.  This networkwas established mainly by conventional horizontal control methods,such as triangulation, trilateration and astronomic azimuths, withsome GPS baselines used in later years.  The adjustment of thesehorizontal observations, together with several hundred observedDoppler positions, provided a practical realization of NAD83 fixed tothe North American tectonic plate.<H3>2. Problems</H3><P>At the time of its initial realization, NAD83 was intended to be ageocentric system and was compatible with the other geocentric systemsof the time, such as the original realization of WGS84.  However, dueto the use of more accurate techniques, it is now known that NAD83 isoffset by about 2 m from the true geocenter. The best geocentricreference frame currently available is the International TerrestrialReference Frame (ITRF).<P>Another limitation of the original realization of NAD83 was thataccess to it was provided mainly through a horizontal control network. Today, many applications of GPS require convenient access to the morefundamental 3D definition of the NAD83 reference system.<P>The accuracy of horizontal control networks based on the originalNAD83 is limited by the accumulation of errors in both theobservations and methods of network integration.  Because Dopplerobservations provided essentially the only measure of absoluteposition, errors in the original NAD83 realization primarily reflectthe metre level uncertainty in these observations.  <A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>illustrates these errors at selected points across Canada by comparingthe adopted NAD83 horizontal control to high accuracy GPS surveys tiedalmost directly to the fundamental reference frame of NAD83 as definedby the VLBI stations.<H3>3. Solution</H3><P>At the XXth General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy andGeophysics in 1992, the International Association of Geodesy (IAG)made the following recommendations in Resolution No. 1 [IAG, 1992]:<P><DL>    <DT><DD>"1)  that groups making highly accurate geodetic, geodynamic or    oceanographic analysis should either use the ITRF directly or    carefully tie their own systems to it"<P>    <DT><DD>"4)  that for high accuracy in continental areas, a system moving with    a rigid [tectonic] plate may be used to eliminate unnecessary    velocities provided it coincides exactly with the ITRS at a specific    epoch"</DL><P>Considering recommendation (1), it is assumed that recommendation (4)also allows for the use of other systems providing they are carefullytied to the ITRS. Note that in ITRF the motions of the individualtectonic plates will cause horizontal coordinates to constantly changein time.  It is therefore necessary to specify which epoch ITRFcoordinates refer to and to account for tectonic motion when changingepochs.<P>To comply with the IAG recommendations, ties between ITRF and NAD83were made via the common VLBI stations, allowing for the accuratedetermination of a conformal 3D similarity (Helmert) transformationbetween the two. This transformation effectively provides a moreaccurate realization of the fundamental 3D NAD83 reference system viathe ITRF that is common to both Canada and the U.S.  It also providesconvenient and nearly direct access to the 3D reference frame of NAD83for the first time.<P>The first ITRF-NAD83 transformation adopted by both Canada and theU.S. was determined with respect to ITRF89 in the early 1990s [Soleret al., 1992].  The scale of ITRF was adopted for compatibility withmore recent versions of WGS84 by setting the estimated scale parameterto zero.  This transformation was used in both Canada and the U.S. toderive NAD83 coordinates for the continuously operating GPS stations(CACS in Canada and CORS in the U.S.) that contribute to thedefinition of the ITRF reference frame.<P>Unfortunately, there was no agreement on how to update thetransformation to new versions of the ITRF. Canada updated using theincremental transformations between different versions of ITRF aspublished by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS).  TheU.S., on the other hand, recomputed the transformation for each newITRF, adopting the scale of each. Consequently, the transformationbetween NAD83 and the more recent ITRFs differed slightly, mainly dueto changes in scale.  Although these scale changes were small and hadlittle effect on the horizontal NAD83 coordinates, it significantlyaffected the definition of the vertical (ellipsoidal heights),resulting in a bias of about 5 cm between ITRF89 and ITRF96.4. ITRF96-NAD83 Transformation<P>In order to reconcile the different realizations of NAD83 based ondifferent ITRF-NAD83 transformations, a new common NAD83transformation was derived with respect the most recent ITRF96.<P>The data used in determining the transformation were NAD83 and ITRF96coordinates at 12 VLBI stations in both Canada and the U.S. (see in<A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>).  These are the only fundamental points in the originaldefinition of NAD83 with 3D coordinates in both NAD83 and ITRF96.  TheITRF96 coordinates at epoch 1997.0, together with their associatedcovariance matrix were obtained from the IERS.  The NAD83 coordinatesand covariance matrix were obtained from ITRF89 using the originalITRF89-NAD83 transformation. This realization of NAD83 is referred tohere as NAD83(ITRF89).<P>The ITRF96-NAD83 transformation was modeled using a weighted7-parameter similarity (Helmert) transformation.  The variance factorwas estimated only for the covariance matrix of the NAD83 coordinates(obtained from ITRF89).  The ITRF96 covariance matrix was consideredknown.<P>The estimated transformation parameters from ITRF96 at epoch 1997.0 toNAD83(ITRF89) are:<P><PRE>    TX(1997.0)  =   0.9910 m    TY(1997.0)  =  -1.9072 m    TZ(1997.0)  =  -0.5129 m    RX(1997.0)  =   -25.79 mas    RY(1997.0)  =    -9.65 mas    RZ(1997.0)  =   -11.66 mas    DS(1997.0)  =     6.62 ppb (not used, set to 0)</PRE><P>where the rotations are clockwise following the unconventional IERSnotation in McCarthy [1996].<P>Note that the scale of ITRF96 was adopted for this realization ofNAD83 by setting the scale change parameter (DS) to zero afterestimation.  This ensures the scale of NAD83 will be compatible withthe more accurate scale defined by ITRF96 and used by other systemssuch as WGS84 (i.e., GPS).<P>In order to correctly account for the tectonic motion of the NorthAmerican tectonic plate when transforming from/to ITRF96 positions atany arbitrary epoch, the NUVEL-1A crustal motion model was adopted[DeMets et al., 1996].  Larson et al. [1997] have shown NUVEL- 1A tobe in good agreement with velocities estimated from GPS in NorthAmerica.  The effect of this motion can be treated as additionalclockwise rotations of the reference frame.  For the North Americanplate these rotations are [McCarthy, 1996, Table 3.2]<P><PRE>    dRX  =   0.0532 mas/y    dRY  =  -0.7423 mas/y    dRZ  =  -0.0316 mas/y</PRE><P>The adopted transformation from ITRF96 at epoch t to NAD83 is thengiven by<P><PRE>    | XNAD83 |     | TX |   |   1     -RZ(t)   RY(t) | | XITRF96 |    | YNAD83 |  =  | TY | + |  RZ(t)    1     -RX(t) | | YITRF96 |    | ZNAD83 |     | TZ |   | -RY(t)   RX(t)    1    | | ZITRF96 |</PRE><P>where TX, TY and TZ are the translations estimated above, and thecombined rotations from ITRF96 (epoch t) to ITRF96 (epoch 1997.0) toNAD83 are<P><PRE>    RX(t)  =  RX(1997.0)  +  dRX x (1997.0-t)    RY(t)  =  RY(1997.0)  +  dRY x (1997.0-t)    RZ(t)  =  RZ(1997.0)  +  dRZ x (1997.0-t)</PRE><P>The inverse transformation from NAD83 to ITRF96 is obtained byreversing the signs on the above transformation parameters.<H3>5. Improved Realization of NAD83</H3><P>The above transformation is used to define an improved realization ofa 3D NAD83 reference frame.  This NAD83 reference frame is thereforeessentially defined in terms of ITRF96, following IAG recommendations.The NUVEL-1A plate motion model is also adopted to transform ITRF96positions at any epoch.<P>To ensure a consistent application of the transformation to otherversions of ITRF, both Canada and the U.S. also agreed to adopt themost current IERS Conventions [McCarthy, 1996] for transforming fromother ITRF reference frames to ITRF96 prior to using the adoptedITRF96-NAD83 transformation.<P>In the U.S., this improved realization of NAD83 is referred to asNAD83(NSRS), where NSRS is an acronym for the National SpatialReference System.  In Canada, it is referred to as NAD83(CSRS), whereCSRS is an acronym for the Canadian Spatial Reference System.<P>The main advantage of this improved realization of NAD83 is that itprovides almost direct access to the NAD83 reference frame throughties to CACS and CORS, the continuously operating GPS stations.  CACSand CORS stations are part of the fundamental global network definingthe ITRF and have accurate ties to the NAD83 VLBI stations.  Thesestations effectively act as both ITRF and NAD83 datum points forspatial positioning in Canada and the U.S., enabling the more accurateintegration of surveys into NAD83 (less accumulation of error) as wellas more convenient access (effectively acting as extra receivers onNAD83 datum points). The adopted transformation also enables thedissemination of IGS-compatible precise GPS ephemerides in both ITRFand NAD83 reference frames, allowing users to perform precise GPSsurveys entirely within NAD83.<P><A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A> displays the differences between (i) NAD83 coordinatesderived from high accuracy GPS surveys using direct ties to CACSstations in NAD83(CSRS) and (ii) those from the NAD83 horizontalcontrol network based on conventional methods and indirect ties to theNAD83 datum points.  The differences are up to the meter level andreflect primarily the distortions present in the horizontal controlnetwork due to the accumulation of errors in the observations andmethods of network integration.<P>It is important to realize that these horizontal differences do notrepresent changes in the NAD83 datum.  The effect of differences inthe realizations of the NAD83 datum are very small.  Horizontalcoordinate shifts are generally within the accuracy of positioningtechniques and are insignificant for most positioning applications.<P>The only significant difference between realizations of NAD83 is achange in scale.  Although the scale difference between the original(1986) NAD83 and NAD83(ITRF89) is about 87 ppb or 9 mm per 100 km, ithas little practical effect on most local and regional positioningapplications.  Its main effect is a shift in ellipsoidal heights ofabout 55 cm.  Because the original NAD83 control network was mainlyhorizontal, this effect is of no practical consequence.<P>The change in scale between NAD83(ITRF89) and NAD83(CSRS/NSRS) is muchsmaller, amounting to only 7 ppb.  Although the effect on thehorizontal coordinates is negligible, it results in a change of 5-7 cmin ellipsoidal heights.  However, this has little impact because ofthe limited use of NAD83 ellipsoidal heights. As noted earlier,NAD83(ITRF89) has been used in Canada only for CACS stations as wellas for some special purpose networks.<P>In the U.S., realizations of NAD83 based on transformations fromITRF93 and ITRF94 were used for the CORS network, which in turn wasused to integrate the High Accuracy Reference Networks (HARNs). Because these ITRFs are not very different from ITRF96, thedifferences between these realizations and NAD83(CSRS/NSRS) arenegligible, both horizontally and vertically.<H3>References</H3><P>Demets, C., R.G.
