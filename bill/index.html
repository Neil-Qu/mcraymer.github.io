When his familymoved to Bala, Ontario in the heart of Muskoka cottage country heattended Gravenhurst High School and worked summers at Dunn'sPavilion, the popular Bala dance hall during the "big band" era.  Itwas during this time that he developed his love for Muskoka.<P>After high school, Bill returned to Montreal to attend McGillUniversity.  He obtained his B.Sc. in 1950, graduating with "greatdistinction."  After declining a teaching position at Queen'sUniversity, Bill entered medical school at McGill.  He graduated in1954 and completed his internship at Toronto Western Hospital.<P>On February 22, 1955, he married Elizabeth Norman, a registered nursefrom Wellesley Hospital in Toronto.  Accompanied by his wife, hestarted his medical career as a young doctor in Bella Bella, a remotenative island community off the coast of British Columbia.  He hadmany stories of the difficulties of working with few modern medicalfacilities.  Often unable to transport patients to better equippedhospitals on the mainland, he quickly learned many difficult medicaland surgical procedures.  After returning to Ontario, Bill beganworking in the public health department of the City of Etobicoke.  Helater entered general practice and industrial medicine in Welland,Ontario.<P>Bill and his family returned to Muskoka in 1958 when he joined theGreig Medical Group in Bracebridge.  He also served as DistrictCoroner for a number of years.  Bill especially enjoyed medicalresearch.  He and his colleague, Dr. Harry Bain of Toronto, were thefirst in North America to discover an abnormal aging condition inchildren.  Although it was very demanding, he enjoyed his work andfound it immensely rewarding.  Many local people still remember him asthe doctor that brought them into the world.<P>After more than 15 years with the Greig Medical Group, Bill's love ofmedical research led him to the Huronia Regional Centre in Orillia.During this time he collaborated with the medical schools at theUniversity of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario.  He wasalso published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.Bill retired from the Huronia Regional Centre in August 1993. However,he still kept busy with part time work, both at HRC and with Dr.Stokes in Bracebridge until 1996.<P>Bill had a great passion for books, especially those on history andscience.  He assembled an enviable library, including rarecollectibles.  If Bill wasn't reading in his spare time, he wasbuilding model airplanes.  His large collection of scale models wasrenowned among local model enthusiasts for its historical accuracy andattention to detail.  He also enjoyed judging the local modelcompetitions at Elliot's department store in Bracebridge.<P>Bill was also a devoted fan of the Montreal Canadiens, closelyfollowing the team for 55 years.  His sons vividly remember the timeshe would take them to see the Habs at the Forum in Montreal.<P>Bill was predeceased by his mother in 1998 and  is survived by hisfather, the Venerable Samuel Craymer, his wife Elizabeth, his fivechildren, Michael and his wife Mary, Jane and her husband Donald,Stephen and his wife Rebecca, John and his wife Patricia, his daughterMary, and his eight grandchildren, Michael John Spencer, Sarah, Lisa,Samuel, Helena, Benjamin, Jessica and Emmett.<P>Funeral services were held on June 8 at St. Thomas' Anglican Church inBracebridge, conducted by Rev. Rosalie Goos.  The eulogy was given byhis long time friend, Robert Clements of Toronto.  Pallbearers wereclose friends, Dr. Ronald Stokes, Robert Clements, Dennis Hay,brother-in-law Ronald Payne, godson Darren Clements and son-in-lawDonald Mink.  Bill requested that any donations be made to the SouthMuskoka Hospital Foundation.</P></BODY></HTML>
