Please make sureto mark down who you played, <B>who won</B> and by what score (gameswon). The league coordinator will add new players at an appropriatelevel taking into account all challenges.<P>The purpose of these challenges is to demonstrate your commitment toplaying your matches each month and to place you at an appropriatelevel in the league. Note that <B>recording only 3-0 losses does nothelp</B> to determine your ranking in the league and will likelyresult in you being put in the bottom house. It is no fun for you ifyou are placed too high in the league and end up losing every game.Likewise, it is no fun for your opponents if you are too low and itwill take you much longer to work your way up to an appropriate level.Try challenging players in lower houses to record some wins or closegames. This will enable the house league coordinator to determine amore appropriate ranking for you in the league.<P><B>Important:</B> It must be made clear to the player being challengedthat you are playing a house league challenge match, as the result mayaffect their standing for the next month.<P>For more information, see the <A HREF="rules.html">House League Rules</A>, oremail <A HREF="http://www.craymer.com/">Mike Craymer</A> or call 592-9598.<P><HR><ADDRESS>These web pages are created and maintained by<A HREF="http://www.craymer.com/">Mike Craymer</A>.<BR>Last revised 2 October 2001</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
