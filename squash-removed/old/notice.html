The playerstandings for this first month are based on last May’s results. No onewas dropped from the league for not playing any games in May. Thisinitial session will continue until the end of October to giveeveryone more time to get into their squash form.<P><H2>Joining the League</H2><P>New players can join the next month’s league by playing at least twocurrent league members as explained in the house league rules. Thechallenger must explain in advance it is a challenge match as theresults may affect the other player's ranking. Record the results onthe New Players list (print clearly!). These challenges demonstrateyour commitment to playing your matches each month and enable theleague coordinator to place you in the league at an appropriate level.Recording only 3-0 losses does not help to determine your level. Trychallenging players in lower houses to record some wins.<P><H2>House League Players Directory</H2><P>The House League Players Directory is available only by email and the<A HREF="http://www.craymer.com/squash/">League web site</A>.Only a few hardcopies of the House League player directory areavailable on the bulletin board at the Club. Make sure to join themailing list to receive your copy automatically at the beginning ofeach month.
