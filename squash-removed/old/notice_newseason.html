The playerstandings for this first month are based on last May's results. No onewas dropped from the league for not playing any games in May. Thisinitial session will continue until the end of October to giveeveryone more time to get into their squash form.<P><HR><A NAME="joining"></A><H2>Joining the League</H2><P>New players can join the next month's league by playing at least twocurrent league members as explained in the <A HREF="rules.html">houseleague rules</A>. The challenger must explain in advance it is achallenge match as the results may affect the other player's ranking.Record the results on the "New House League Players" list and provideyour contact information, including email (print clearly!).<P>These challenges demonstrate your commitment to playing your matcheseach month and enable the league coordinator to place you at anappropriate level in the league. Recording only 3-0 losses does nothelp to determine your level. Try challenging players in lower housesto record some wins. For more information see <A HREF="joining.html">Howto Joining the League</A>.<P><HR><A NAME="directory"></A><H2>House League Players Directory</H2><P>The House League Players Directory is available only by email and the<A HREF="directory.html">League web site</A>. Only a few hardcopies ofthe House League player directory are available on the bulletin boardat the Club. Make sure to join the mailing list to receive your copyautomatically at the beginning of each month. Please also statewhether or not you wish your email address to be visible to the otherrecipients of the monthly directory. No email addresses will bepublished on this Web site. Send your request to<A HREF="mailto:squash@craymer.com">squash@craymer.com</A>.<P><HR><A NAME="inactive"></A><H2>Inactive Players</H2><P>All house league players who do not play any league games will beenremoved from next month's league.  These players make it unfair andinconvenient for others in their house.  To make the experience funfor everyone, please try to play all your games and note the followingrules:<P><H4>Defaulting a Match</H4><P>If a challenged player refuses to play, does not make any attempt toreturn the challenger's calls or does not show up for an arrangedmatch, a default win will be awarded to the challenger.  Thechallenger should make at least two attempts to call, leaving messagesindicating that he/she is challenging.  Arrange your games earlier inthe month to avoid scheduling problems later in the month. Schedulingproblems at the end of the month will <B><U>not</U></B> be considereda legitimate reason for claiming a default match. Always email thecoordinator at <A HREF="mailto:squash@craymer.com">squash@craymer.com</A>to explain the reason for any default win.<P><H4>Leave of Absence</H4><P>Players expecting to have difficulty completing house league matchesduring a particular month should request a leave of absence.  Theywill be placed at the same level upon their return the followingmonth. Absences of two months or more will require challenging backinto the league.<P><H4>Rejoining the League</H4><P>Players who wish to rejoin the house league after an extended absencemust challenge at least two current league players and record the gamescores (wins) on the "New House League Players" list.  Rejoiningplayers will be placed at an appropriate level the next month based ontheir wins.<P><HR><A NAME="etiquette"></A><H2>Court Etiquette</H2><P><OL><LI>Before entering an occupied court, wait until the players finish    the rally in progress, and then knock on the door.</LI><LI>During the warm-up before your game, give your opponent equal    opportunity to hit the ball.</LI><LI>During the match, give your opponent time to prepare to receive    the service.</LI><LI>Do not unnecessarily delay the game or stall for time to catch    your breath.</LI><LI>Make every effort to move away from the ball after you hit it, to    give your opponent a clear path to move directly to the ball.</LI><LI>If your opponent is in a position which might cause you to hit    him/her with the ball or your racquet, stop and ask for a let.    Replay the point rather than risk injury to your opponent!</LI><LI>If a let is called on you in a friendly game, award a stroke to    your opponent if it is warranted.
