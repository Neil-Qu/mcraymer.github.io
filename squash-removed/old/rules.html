Houses are numbered from one according to        descending skill level.    <P>    <LI>Over a one month period each player must arrange one match with        the other members of their house.  The Dunlop double yellow dot        ball is the official ball for league play.    <P>	<LI>A match consists of the best of five games.  The winner of a match is either:<P>        <OL TYPE=a START="1">	    <LI>the player who first wins three games, OR	    <LI>the player who leads in games completed and won, OR        <LI>if the games are tied, the players who leads the score in the            unfinished game (the unfinished game only counts when breaking a tie), OR        <LI>if both the games and score are tied, the match is a tie and the            number of completed games won by each player is recorded.<P>        </OL>        The winner of each game is the first player to get 9 points. However, if the        score is tied at 8-8, the first player to reach 8 points decides whether the        game will be played 9 or 10 points; i.e., one or two more points.    <P>    <LI>The results of each match should be <A        HREF="recording.html">recorded</A> on the posted house league score        sheets.  Each player should record the number of games they won on        their own row, under their opponent's column.    <P>    <LI>The ranking of players in a house is determined according to the        total number of points obtained as follows:<P>        <UL TYPE=DISC>	    <LI>1 point for each game won        <LI>2 additional points for each match won or 1 additional point for            each match tied        </UL>        <P>        At the end of each month the top player in each house moves up one        house and the bottom player moves down one house.  The other players        remain in the same house.  The house league coordinator may adjust        these transitions when players are clearly misplaced or when players        are added to or dropped from the league.    <P>    <LI>Players are expected to be ready and available to play all of        their matches.  If more than one match is missed, the player may be        dropped from the league.  If a player fails to appear or return repeated        calls for a match, the match shall be forfeited as a 3-0 loss.    <P>    <LI>Players expecting to have difficulty completing their matches        during a particular month should request a leave of absence prior to        the start of the next month.  If returning after only one month        absence, they should record their name on the "New House League Players" list,        giving their old house number.  They will then be returned to the same        level.  If returning after more than two months absence, they must        challenge back into the league as <A HREF="joining.html">new players</A>.    <P>    <LI>New players wishing to join the house league must challenge at least        <U>two</U> current league members to best-of-five matches and record the        results (games won-lost) on the "New House League Players" list following        the instructions at the top of the list. Do not submit scores by email to        the house league coordinator. Challengers must also make it clear to their        opponents that they are challenging to get into the league, as the result of        the match could affect their opponent's ranking the next month. New players        will be added to the next month's house league at an appropriate level based        on their challenge results.    <P>    <LI>New players may re-adjust their position in the league after winning        <U>all</U> matches in their current house by challenging and defeating        <U>two players</U> in higher houses.  They will then be assigned to a        new house between the two players defeated.</OL><P>For more information, email <A HREF="http://www.craymer.com/">Mike Craymer</A>or call 592-9598.<P><HR><ADDRESS>These web pages are created and maintained by<A HREF="http://www.craymer.com/">Mike Craymer</A>.<BR>Last revised 7 January 2007</ADDRESS></BODY></HTML>
